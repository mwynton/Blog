    <h1> Whats this all about then?
    </h1>
    
    <p>Okay, so here is the basic rundown of me. I’m a  37 year old man who has been working in hospitality for the last 15 years. I have been wanting to make a career change for quite a while now, it’s not that I don’t enjoy my job, I actually really enjoy being a bartender, how it is as some would say, a young persons’ game. </p>

    <p>I love the idea of being able to work remotely, and the freedom that comes with that. Don’t get me wrong, I know there will be downsides to working remotely too, but the idea of a remote working location excites me.</p>

    <p>With being a bartender, I get to meet a lot of people on a daily basis. The past six months, I have been asking customers regularly what they do for work. Some had answers that interested me, and some didn’t, but I was basically waiting to hear the words “work remotely” and then I would start my interrogation towards them, whilst they were just trying to enjoy a quiet drink! To be fair to all of them, they were very helpful and open with what they did, how they got into it, their enjoyment levels and how best for myself to get into that field or at least to start working remote in some capacity.</p>

    <p>Then Sam came along. Now I’ve know Sam for a good few years now, we play on the same football (soccer) team, and he started working in my bar on a part time level, as kind of a fun job for him. Chatting to him, I told him about my struggle to find “the next step” and started to talk to him about his job, web development. After grilling him for a good period of time, the man could be interrogated by the SAS and he’d still come up with answers, it finally felt that I had found something that I would enjoy and could really get my teeth into. It was also refreshing to not feel alone in taking on the course, as Sam had offered to help with any questions or stumbling blocks that I would come up against.</p>

    <p>So, the journey has now finally begun. I thought it would be interesting to blog my journey, the ups and the downs, to help me and you see how far I am able to take this as I transition into a new chapter of my life. Maybe this is something that you yourself can relate to, or maybe it’s just something that you have come across by mistake, either way, here we go!</p>
