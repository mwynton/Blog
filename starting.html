    <h1> A slow start, is still a start</h1>

    <p>First thing’s first, deciding that I wanted to pursue a career in web development was one thing, however knowing where to start was another. I had been told that Coursera offer thousands of online courses and after checking them out, I decided to sign up and take this avenue. The 60% off might have been the deciding factor for me!</p>

    <p>The next part was I needed to find a course that I felt would fit with my needs. What were my needs? An extremely basic introduction to web development which assumed that I knew nothing, which I didn’t, and would clearly and slowly walk me through each process and procedure behind web development. </p>

    <p>The course I decided on was an Introduction to Web Development from the University of California, Davis. The lecturer was William Mead, and he offered a great insight into web development, the platforms that I would need and how to use them. He got me using Visual Studio Code and GitHub, both of which were described clearly and easy to follow.</p>

    <p>The course consisted of four parts: Introduction to HTML, Links, Files and Images, Putting Your Site Online, and an Introduction to CSS. I took my time doing the course, as I wanted it all to make as much sense as possible and also not to become overwhelmed with all the information I was receiving. I only had to ask Sam once for some help, and that was with linking files that were a few files back. I’m not sure if William told me about this step and I missed it, or if he just forgot to put it on the course, either way, it was an easy fix but showed the importance of having someone who can help you when you get stuck.</p>
